## This code is to find the best conv_params and fc_params using GA. 

You can debug ***main.py*** to get the result. 

    CNN_params = dict(
        conv_num=[1,5],
        conv_output=[1,4],
        fc_num=[1,4],
        fc_output=[1,8])
        
I am confusing about the result, compared with VGG, the loss of the final framwork is improved, but if the network is deep, the loss didn't improved anymore.
